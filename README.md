# Learn Ember.js

Tracking my learning progress for Ember.js, a frontend framework for web design.

## Motivation

Years ago, I was digging down the rabbit hole for frontend development. I made
some progress by developing web pages, learning HTML, CSS and JS. I even started
my own CSS framework ([style-cheat.io](https://style-cheat.io)). Web technology
made some huge steps in the meantime, and my knowledge might be outdated and
a bit rusty. I also want to work towards some future goals for
[while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io).

## Description

[Ember.js](https://emberjs.com) is a frontend framework, written in JavaScript.
It brings basically everything one needs to build a fully functional single-page
application. You get routing, components, state handling, auth handling and even
a complete test framework included.

After the build, a simple web server like Nginx or Apache HTTPD can run the
application.

### Courses

I am starting with the courses provided by Ember.js itself. You can find these
in the
[documentation](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/quick-start/).


### Notes

Notes and documentation can be found in the [docs/](docs/) directory. These will
mostly contain links, ideas, hints, explanations and stuff that does not fit
elsewhere.

### Exercises

Excersises will gathered in the [exercises/](exercises/) directory. Each
exercise will have a small README alongside to explain whats going on and how
to start the example.
